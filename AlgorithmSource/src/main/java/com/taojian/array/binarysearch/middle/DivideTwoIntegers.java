 * <p>
 * Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.
 * <p>
 * Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
 * <p>
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
 * Output: -2
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
 * The divisor will never be 0.
 * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range:
 * [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 when the division
 * result overflows.
